# Basic Python Boilerplate

A Python script designed to generate boilerplate code for new Python projects. It creates a basic structure for a Python script, including a header with metadata, a clear screen function, and a main function. The script also allows users to include popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and more based on their needs.

## Features

- Generates boilerplate code for Python scripts.
- Includes essential libraries like `sys`, `os`, `datetime`, and `json`.
- Allows optional inclusion of popular libraries.
- Prompts for project metadata and stores it in a `config.json` file.

## Usage

1. Run the script with Python: `python create_boilerplate.py <filename>`.
2. Follow the prompts to select libraries and enter project metadata.

## Installation

No installation required. Simply clone the repository and run the script.
